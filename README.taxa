For the code for this version (0.2) Chris used the various "easternTaxa...", "westernTaxa..." files to determine what taxa to include and what to lump into Other hardwood. The level3s_0.2.csv file is an attempt to put this info in standardized conversion table format. For version 0.3 and forward the composition model preprocessing code will actually use the level3s_{version}.csv files directly.
