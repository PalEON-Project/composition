eastern and western first runs 0.1 (run0) finished though some problems in writing to disk or something so there were error msgs; need to rerun prob calcs for western


2/14/14:
eastern-0 is first long 100k run; sigma2 mixing is slow
eastern-1 is another run where I use seed of 1 and do runif(0.1,3) for sigma init; I'm changing the code in code/mcmc.R temporarily

2/3/14:

in mcmc.R, having W be many rows, few columns better than transposed, presumablybecause R and Rcpp both have column-major storage
code/mcmc{,Auxil}.transposedW.R tests with having many columns

2/2/14:

in fit for BAM for western, I included Illegible in Other but at the moment not doing that, on the thought that those are trees that are likely in our used taxa so don't want to put as 'other' since they are likely not

3/17/14:
I think i will leave out 'unknown tree' now.
need more info on dogwood in eastern town to see if there are enough to model
leave out mulberry as not in east town and probably rare
cherry (1700) and sycamore (1200) not modelled but gum (2200) and walnut(2800) are

west should have all 21 eastern taxa but no white cedar or chestnut since zero trees

7/12/14:
added lindgren_nu1 branch that has Lindgren model with nu=1 and (for now) no boundary correction; this has RW on log(rho)=eta, with joint sampling of rho,alpha

arggh - running time is a lot longer because the precision matrices are not as sparse

(actually joint sampling is -- as of Aug 14 -- of rho/sigma/alpha)

August/14:
lindgren_nu1_logsigma2 branch has sigma2 proposal on log scale

added possibility of boundary and of CV; initial bdry didn't fix boundary effects; runnign CV as well as test case
these are 0.3-5 and 0.3-6

not sure difference of 0.3-2,0.3-3, 0.3-4: between 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 probably switched to log sigma proposal

0.3-3: possibly not log(sigma) scale?
0.3-4: joint eta-sigma?
0.3-5: log(sigma) scale, but maybe 0.3-4 was too?
0.3-6: is cv with lindgren nu1
0.3-7: cv with car

8/29/14:
weird stuff with spam hidden copy of chol.spam objects in 3.1 and bogus results
basically the call to update.spam goes to .Fortran and because changes in Uprop are made there, U[[p]] is never copied and just refers to Uprop

I've updated mcmc.R to force the copy and now things seem to give same results on R 3.0 and R 3.1

9/5/14:
needed to deal with issue with starting values that if alphas not initiated via Gibbs to be consistent with w's and sigmas then the CAR model had 0 acceptance for sigma2 for some taxa; now that I do this, things are fine

the bdry effect for Lindgren is not really a bdry - you can see a frame around the actual bdry, but the problem for us is in the little bulges between data around the edges

going to use a bdry of 6 not 10 as it doesn't really seem to matter much

would be good to try a TPS run and see what it does there

runs
0.3-10: bin, 5% cv # running
0.3-11: lind, 5% cv  # running
0.3-12: tps, 5% cv
0.3-13: bin, 20% cv for cells
0.3-14: lind, 20% cv for cells
0.3-15: tps, 20% cv for cells
0.3-16: bin, no bdry, no CV (final run)



-10 and -11 have adaptStartDecay at 5000 but I just changed it to be the same as $burnin

running short version of -12 to see if tps w/o bdry correction shows same bdry effect as lindgren - indeed w/o bdry correction shows weird incursions seen in lindgren

then will run full long version with the bdry correction
[*** check if see incursions when have bdry correct - yes some but not as bad as w/ lindgren (9/27/14)]

changing westernData.Rda to have version number in it

9/13/14:
run 0.3-10 for bin doesn't seem to have as good mixing for sig2 as did run0 for ver 0.2
should try to do some more test runs where I do sigma on sd scale, include alpha and sigma alone and do the start values differently; do this after do CV stuff; but actually it might just be the effect of CV

9/14/14:
had to modify code because in tps run I was getting sig2 go to 0 for one rare taxon (bl gm/sw gum?). so now I have a lower bound of .0001

9/18/14:
checking that lindgren_nu1 with modified spam-related code and new spam version gives same results as before - it's fine as long as I make sure to use same boundary

9/27/14:

made config files (e.g., config_0.3-11) for each run and said in master to do a cp to 'config'

arggh - the 0.3-12 tps run has no bdry so not totally consistent with bin and lindgren_nu1

10/18/14:
I reran the 0.3-12 tps to deal with the inconsistency

my 0.3 dataset differs from 0.3 on wiki. It's almost the same as the 0.3-1 except for 39 extra other hardwood in 0.3-1 all of which occur in cells that in my 0.3 had no other hardwood

11/11/14:
calc_cv_western.R now saves results info in form of arrays in *-cvResults.Rda

12/7/14:
I reported to Simon that initial v0.4 of gridded western has a lot more tamarack and spruce than before, counts in some (many?) MN and WI cells that differ a bit from v 0.3 and is missing fir in east (in MI)

*** upshot is that 0.3 and 0.3-1 western datasets were messed up so version 0.2 composition product in west is messed up ***

12/9/14:
the white spots for oak in SE MN seem real based on plotting %age no.tree - there is a N-S band there with very high % no.tree
also biomass estimates show 0 biomass in that area as well

updated level3s to deal with bl gum, sw gum, bl gum/sw gum, and related issues given new data from Simon; uploading this to the Wiki

planning to model cherry,dogwood,gum,walnut which have ~2300, ~3100, ~2600, ~3500 trees but not sycamore ~1500 trees

have to do atl white cedar (336 trees) as its not hardwood o.w. have to leave out entirely as we do bald cypress (only 5 trees)

so 23 taxa total, but 21 in west since won't model chestnut or atl white cedar there

I checked the 02 OH and 0.9 eastern and the CSV files look reasonable except for one OH township with 13k trees - asking Charlie about it - see below
OH CSV and shapefiles correspond
eastern CSV has ID not matching ID hidden in polygons. IDs in polygons start at 0, those in CSV start at 1

Charlie says the Buckskin OH township with a ton of data is legit: Yes a weird Twp., but the value is a total from Crowl's 1937 thesis for all the Virginia Military Tract (lots of metes & bounds properties with many witness trees per lot) in Ross Co. west of the Scioto River. It is an outlier for type of survey, the number of trees,  and size of the sample polygon. It is however realistic and very informative on the local proportions. Sorry if it weights too heavily in any analysis. So much for diversity as it cannot be easily broken out.

12/31/14:
Jody has fixed the ID stuff in eastern 1372 v0.9

I'm cleaning up files in the repository and putting log and config files for the
 runs in summer/fall 2014 that used bad v 0.3 western data in data_paper_old_runs

also including packrat for pkg version control

version 0.3-0 will be the core data product run, while 0.3-{1,2,...} will be the CV runs (actually I'm changing this up - see below)

1/4/15:

found bug in code/mcmc.R that pertains only to eastern fitting - wasn't updating U[[p]] to reflect new 'n' values

1/23/15:

running 0.3 and 0.3-1 for eastern where 0.3-1 has separate alpha and sigma2 updates because initial eastern run seems to show worse sigma2 mixing than for version 0.2
(0.3 is now 0.3-2)

having separate alpha nad sigma2 definitely seems to help and almost gives as good results as 0.2 runs back in spring 2014; still not sure why it might nto be quite as good

2/8/15:
old 0.3 runs (-10,-11, etc.) were based on incorrect data inputs

Simon fixed for western 0.4-3, but still issues with water/no.tree that don't affect composition

east runs (0.3 and 0.3-1) suggest it's worth using 0.3-1 and that burnin should be 1-50, keeping 51-300
same for west, though for gum and dogwood, burnin not quite complete at 51, but keeping at that for consistency even for them
mixing of preds in east and west seems good, even for gum/dogwood in west

going ahead with use of 0.4-3 for now but check later that input data would be same once he fixed datasets

new CV runs will be:
95% holdout:
bin (-101), lindgren (-102), tps (-103)
80% holdout
bin (-104), lindgren (-105), tps (-106)


at the moment the PLScomposition_{western,eastern}_0.3.nc final files are generated from PLScomposition_{western,eastern}_0.3-1_full.nc

in various files should probably change 0.3-1 to 0.3 and vice versa

2/13/15:
changed 0.3 runs to 0.3-2

changing old eastern 0.3-1 to 0.3-0

new 0.3-0 western will be with updated western 0.5 that simon just fixed
also running 0.3-100 on old cluster as backup

checked 0.5 western data (plot of presence of data and raw proportions and total counts and things look reasonable)

0.3-{101-106} are cv runs

2/28/15:

0.3-0 are the final east and west runs
0.3-2 are runs w/o separate alpha/sigma updates and for west are based on bad data
0.3-1 western might be the run w/ separate updates but based on bad data

I've renamed the 0.3-0 .nc files as {east,midwest}_composition_v0.3.nc for posting on wiki

3/14/15:
tps (102,105) cv runs have fairly bad mixing and some very high sigma values for many taxa
this is consistent with previous runs

3/16/15:
cv numbers are much larger in magnitude because after Simon's repreocessing there are a lot more trees in "minnesota subregion" (x<300000) (234k vs. 113k)

7/7/15:
got 0.6-2 western from Simon with additional LMW data from Jody

version0.4 will be based on this with the eastern v0.4 just a copy of eastern v0.3 since input data have not changed

I made a branch version0.3 and am now working with v0.4 in branch master

7/25/15:
0.4-0 is core run
0.4-{101-106} follow naming conventions from before
haven't started TPS runs yet - code dying on cluster for some reason

having to do drawProportions() manually for 0.4-0 as can't fork because of memory limits - not sure why it's using 2.7 Gb RAM...

8/3/15:
starting TPS runs on gandalf

8/5/15:
sigma2 mixing for 0.4-0 seems similar to 0.3-0
as w/ 0.3, Lindgren mixing not as good and there are very large sigma2 values
