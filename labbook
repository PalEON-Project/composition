eastern and western first runs 0.1 (run0) finished though some problems in writing to disk or something so there were error msgs; need to rerun prob calcs for western


2/14/14:
eastern-0 is first long 100k run; sigma2 mixing is slow
eastern-1 is another run where I use seed of 1 and do runif(0.1,3) for sigma init; I'm changing the code in code/mcmc.R temporarily

2/3/14:

in mcmc.R, having W be many rows, few columns better than transposed, presumablybecause R and Rcpp both have column-major storage
code/mcmc{,Auxil}.transposedW.R tests with having many columns

2/2/14:

in fit for BAM for western, I included Illegible in Other but at the moment not doing that, on the thought that those are trees that are likely in our used taxa so don't want to put as 'other' since they are likely not

3/17/14:
I think i will leave out 'unknown tree' now.
need more info on dogwood in eastern town to see if there are enough to model
leave out mulberry as not in east town and probably rare
cherry (1700) and sycamore (1200) not modelled but gum (2200) and walnut(2800) are

west should have all 21 eastern taxa but no white cedar or chestnut since zero trees

7/12/14:
added lindgren_nu1 branch that has Lindgren model with nu=1 and (for now) no boundary correction; this has RW on log(rho)=eta, with joint sampling of rho,alpha
