eastern and western first runs 0.1 (run0) finished though some problems in writing to disk or something so there were error msgs; need to rerun prob calcs for western


2/14/14:
eastern-0 is first long 100k run; sigma2 mixing is slow
eastern-1 is another run where I use seed of 1 and do runif(0.1,3) for sigma init; I'm changing the code in code/mcmc.R temporarily

2/3/14:

in mcmc.R, having W be many rows, few columns better than transposed, presumablybecause R and Rcpp both have column-major storage
code/mcmc{,Auxil}.transposedW.R tests with having many columns

2/2/14:

in fit for BAM for western, I included Illegible in Other but at the moment not doing that, on the thought that those are trees that are likely in our used taxa so don't want to put as 'other' since they are likely not

3/17/14:
I think i will leave out 'unknown tree' now.
need more info on dogwood in eastern town to see if there are enough to model
leave out mulberry as not in east town and probably rare
cherry (1700) and sycamore (1200) not modelled but gum (2200) and walnut(2800) are

west should have all 21 eastern taxa but no white cedar or chestnut since zero trees

7/12/14:
added lindgren_nu1 branch that has Lindgren model with nu=1 and (for now) no boundary correction; this has RW on log(rho)=eta, with joint sampling of rho,alpha

arggh - running time is a lot longer because the precision matrices are not as sparse

(actually joint sampling is -- as of Aug 14 -- of rho/sigma/alpha)

August/14:
lindgren_nu1_logsigma2 branch has sigma2 proposal on log scale

added possibility of boundary and of CV; initial bdry didn't fix boundary effects; runnign CV as well as test case
these are 0.3-5 and 0.3-6

not sure difference of 0.3-2,0.3-3, 0.3-4: between 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 probably switched to log sigma proposal

0.3-3: possibly not log(sigma) scale?
0.3-4: joint eta-sigma?
0.3-5: log(sigma) scale, but maybe 0.3-4 was too?
0.3-6: is cv with lindgren nu1
0.3-7: cv with car

8/29/14:
weird stuff with spam hidden copy of chol.spam objects in 3.1 and bogus results
basically the call to update.spam goes to .Fortran and because changes in Uprop are made there, U[[p]] is never copied and just refers to Uprop

I've updated mcmc.R to force the copy and now things seem to give same results on R 3.0 and R 3.1

needed to deal with issue with starting values that if alphas not initiated via Gibbs to be consistent with w's and sigmas then the CAR model had 0 acceptance for sigma2 for some taxa; now that I do this, things are fine

the bdry effect for Lindgren is not really a bdry - you can see a frame around the actual bdry, but the problem for us is in the little bulges between data around the edges

going to use a bdry of 6 not 10 as it doesn't really seem to matter much

would be good to try a TPS run and see what it does there

runs
0.3-10: bin, 5% cv # running
0.3-11: lind, 5% cv  # running
0.3-12: tps, 5% cv
0.3-13: bin, 20% cv for cells
0.3-14: lind, 20% cv for cells
0.3-15: tps, 20% cv for cells
0.3-16: bin, no bdry, no CV (final run)



-10 and -11 have adaptStartDecay at 5000 but I just changed it to be the same as $burnin

running short version of -12 to see if tps w/o bdry correction shows same bdry effect as lindgren - indeed w/o bdry correction shows weird incursions seen in lindgren

then will run full long version with the bdry correction
[*** check if see incursions when have bdry correct - yes some but not as bad as w/ lindgren (9/27/14)]

changing westernData.Rda to have version number in it

9/13/14:
run 0.3-10 for bin doesn't seem to have as good mixing for sig2 as did run0 for ver 0.2
should try to do some more test runs where I do sigma on sd scale, include alpha and sigma alone and do the start values differently; do this after do CV stuff; but actually it might just be the effect of CV

9/14/14:
had to modify code because in tps run I was getting sig2 go to 0 for one rare taxon (bl gm/sw gum?). so now I have a lower bound of .0001

9/18/14:
checking that lindgren_nu1 with modified spam-related code and new spam version gives same results as before - it's fine as long as I make sure to use same boundary

9/27/14:

made config files (e.g., config_0.3-11) for each run and said in master to do a cp to 'config'

arggh - the 0.3-12 tps run has no bdry so not totally consistent with bin and lindgren_nu1
